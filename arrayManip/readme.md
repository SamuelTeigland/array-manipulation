The purpose of this program is to manipulate arrays using pointers. My friend who is currently in a data structures class needed help with this program, so I gave him some help.

The first part of this program is to take in user input for the size of the array. We store the size of the array in the arraySize variable.

Then we have the user enter in the values that they would like to have stored in the array.

The purpose of this program is to perform two functions. It reverses the array they originally input by using a for loop and pointers that are passed through the function called arrayReverse().

The second function is to take a value that the user inputs and fill the array with that value using pointers. This is done through the arrayFill() function, which contains a for loop and a pointer that is pointing to the original numbers[] array that was created at the beginning in int main().
